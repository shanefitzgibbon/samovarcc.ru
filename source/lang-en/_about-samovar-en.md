ABOUT US
========

Samovar Cook&Chat Club is a place for those who love foreign languages, travelling, cultures & cuisines of the world.
We created a place where you can learn a new language and cooking skills at the same time because we think that cooking is a great opportunity to engage in a foreign culture and language as it offers a friendly and motivating atmosphere.
Cooking classes for adults are conducted either by professional chefs or by people who we consider to be amazing chefs and amazing people. We are inviting everyone to gather around our Samovar, cook & chat together and have a great time.
So choose a language, book a class and we are looking forward to seeing you at our Samovar!
The cuisines available now are Russian, Uzbek, French, Italian and Thai.
We consider important to give back to the community so please join our charity events.
