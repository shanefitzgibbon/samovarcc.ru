We have a lot of cooking classes in English that are conducted by chefs (some professional, some amateur but still brilliant) from Australia, Canada, USA and England. We do different cuisines – Greek, Thai, Vietnamese, Mexican, Russian and many more in English. 

It’s a great way to meet fun people – locals and expats, cook up a storm and have a great meal at the end.

Cooking classes for kids are done in English by a professional teacher from the British American school and gives children a great opportunity to learn cooking skill and have language exchange with the local kids.

If you want to sign up for a cooking class in English, stay tuned for the upcoming classes on our website. If you have a group of at least 4 people we can organize a cooking class at a convenient time.
