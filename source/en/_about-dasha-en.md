Dasha Stoochnoff
----------------

Dasha Stoochnoff, a fifth generation Canadian of Russian descent, arrived for an intended one year adventure in Moscow late 2005; more than six years later, she continues to work at an international school as a Primary Teacher and Deputy Head Teacher.

She earned her degrees (Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Education) from Simon Fraser University and the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
Having worked in several establishments of various culinary flavours, she opened a South Indian restaurant in Vancouver.

While some of her many interests include travelling, Scuba diving, photography, and writing, Dasha has always had a passion for cooking, and enjoys trying out new culinary concoctions on her friends, as well as introducing children to the art of cuisine.

Once she makes it back home to the rural waterfront setting in British Columbia, sheâ€™ll take up organic gardening once again, harvesting new ideas for lifelong health and well-being.
