If your child likes to cook and you’re looking for a fun way to celebrate his or her birthday, book a cooking party with us and we’ll tailor a menu for you! Please book birthday parties at least 1 week in advance.

We focus on healthy food, team work and creativity. Teaching children about the nutritious qualities of foods is a priority as well.

Currently we do cooking classes at Obraz zhizni restaurant on Sundays at 1pm (please see calendar for details), classes are conducted in English with a little bit of Russian. Children learn to make healthy meals and help each other learn one another’s languages while being supervised experienced teachers.
