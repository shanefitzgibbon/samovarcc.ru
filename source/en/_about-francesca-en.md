Francesca Loche
---------------

Francesca is a Russophile from Sardinia who came to Moscow to follow her passion for Russian language and culture. Here she teaches Italian and also works as an interpreter.

Francesca grew up in a traditional Italian family where cooking was always a big part of their lives. She loves to cook for her friends and family and believes that the taste of the dishes depends on how much love was added into them. Which is why a meal cooked for your loved ones is bound to be good.

Food for Italians is also an excuse to get together at a table in good company and have a great time, and Francesca recreates the atmosphere of a traditional Italian dinner in her cooking classes.
